### Files

- index.js (same of `bundle.js`, you don't need this as you have the latest one generated by yourself)
- index.html (copy contents in `<head>...</head><body>...</body>` to your index.html, remove **duplicates** if exists any, change the line `<link href='index.css' .../>`, see below)
- index.css (copy this file to your site's `root` folder as `webRoot/path/to/<this>.css` and then embed it in your `index.html` as `<link   href='path/to/<this>.css' rel='stylesheet' />`)

That's it, good to go ðŸŽ‰

### Dev suggestion

if you're in an active development mode (before running `npm run build` and upload generated `bundle.js`), try this command:

`npm run dev`

then, whatever source code you change under `/client/js/*` (or even only <kbd>cmd</kbd>+s is pressed), source code would be "re-compiled", and you can preview the result in web browser at `http:localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/client/index.html`.

Upside of this:
* auto refresh your web browser to see the effect of your last changes

Downside of this:
* a VIRTUAL version of the `bundle.js` is generated ___in memory___. (notice it's in memory, not persisted on your disk!)

In nutshell, my advice is use `npm run dev` at dev mode to quickly preview your changes, and run `npm run build` to get the **real** minified and compressed `bundle.js`.
